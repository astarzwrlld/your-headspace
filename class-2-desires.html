        <h2>Where is god?</h2>
        <p>A great deal of the population would be throughly hurt to know that they are not special. There is no one watching
            out for you, caring for you. No one cares if you steal or cheat. I think that it's easier to believe in a world
            where bad things always happen to bad people. Everyone is exactly who you would be if you were them. We search 
            for the divine, for the spirit, in something greater, but all along we've been the great. </p>
